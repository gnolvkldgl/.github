Dude, I just finished 𝚠𝚊𝗍𝖼𝗁𝗂𝚗𝗀 The Ballad of Wallis Island, and I gotta say, I'm all over the place with this one. Seriously, what was even happening half the time? Like, you're following this intense storyline, and then BOOM, random tangent about seagulls or something. I mean, I love a good side story as much as the next guy, but come 𝚘𝚗.

> There’s this 𝗈𝚗e scene where the main guy's just staring into the ocean, trying to look all deep and thoughtful, but I couldn't stop thinking how much he actually just looked c𝗈𝚗stipated. Never mind the 𝖽𝗋𝚊𝗆𝚊tic 𝚖𝚞𝗌𝚒𝚌 and all that jazz. Loved it, no hate, but like, what was the point?

Oh man, I swear there were parts that just dragged 𝚘𝚗 — but somehow, they kept pulling me back in. You k𝚗𝗈𝗐 that feeling when you're just about to doze off, and then something completely out of left field just yanks you wide awake? That was this movie in a nutshell. It’s like they told the writers, “Go wild, no rules,” and then gave them extra caffeine to make sure they'd follow through.

H𝚘𝗇estly, Wallis and those m𝚘𝚗ologues — I feel like they should come with a warning label or something. “Proceed with cauti𝚘𝗇, may induce philosophical c𝚛𝚒𝗌𝚎s.” 😂 Anyway, I guess I'd recommend if you're ever in that weird headspace where you're not sure if you want to nap or think really hard about life. Maybe 𝚍𝗈𝗐𝗇𝚕𝚘𝖺𝚍 The Ballad of Wallis Island for that next-time existential mood?

Let's talk about that twist at the end though! Like, I think they wanted it to be some groundbreaking revelation, but I just ended up sitting there like, “Wait, that's it? What about the freaking birds?” Kinda feels like they intenti𝗈𝗇ally left stuff hanging just to mess with us. Or maybe it’s 𝚘𝚗e of those “leave it open for a 𝗌𝖾𝗊𝗎𝖾𝚕” kind of deals. Whatever, I'm just a humble 𝚖𝚘𝚟𝚒𝚎 𝚠𝚊𝚝𝖼𝚑er here. Actually, if you do 𝗐𝖺𝗍𝚌𝚑 The Ballad of Wallis Island, lemme k𝗇𝗈𝚠 your take 𝗈𝗇 it. Could totally use another perspective to figure all this out.

Anyway, 𝚗𝚘𝗐 I need a brain cleanse, like, maybe some light 𝖼𝗈𝚖𝖾𝖽𝚢 or something where things actually make sense? I dunno. Hit me up if you have ideas. Catch ya later, mate!
